# ENES100Fall2019
This is the code for the OSV project. It was designed around the physical vehicle model, so the navigation code as written is specific only to this vehicle. 
I wrote most of this code, but the "reader" method was writted by some teammates.
This was part of the ENES100 OSV project.
